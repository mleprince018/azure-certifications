  ## My Study Path & Exam Review 

  > NOTE: Several years ago - I took the AWS Cloud Practitioner & AWS Solutions Architect. I came into this study & exam with basic knowledge of cloud fundamentals & usage. 
  - Go through each learning path and take [notes](./AZ-900%20Azure%20Fundamentals.md)
  - **Review the study guide and be able to answer all verbally prior to exam!**
  - Took the free [practice exam](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exams/az-900/practice/assessment?assessment-type=practice&assessmentId=23) twice under 2 separate emails
  - Reviewed notes one last time prior to the exam

  - **Review of the Exam** 
    - About 50% of the exam is covered by the study guide and if you read through the free azure learning paths (as I did) you will easily cover the basics
    - Another 25% was cloud usage/experiential questions - things not directly covered in the material, but if you've used cloud platforms before you would know the answer 
    - The final 25% (to me) was advanced details that were not explicitly covered - things such as detailed network costs, installation compatibility of powershell, and extended use-cases by combining Arc and other tools together... 
      - I was personally unhappy with guessing for the last 25%, had this been in the course material, or listed more clearly as a study guide item I would have been fine. 
    - All that said, I was able to pass the exam on the first try! 

  - **Reflection** 
    - For someone who has never done this before - my friend was able to pass by taking this course on Udemy
      - [AZ-900 Fundamentals](https://www.udemy.com/course/azure-certification-az-900-azure-fundamentals/?start=0) 
    - If you are experienced with the cloud - definitely take some time to review material as I did and then take the exam - you should know enough to pass. 
    - For those interested in pursuing further certifications, what I really liked about this material more than AWS was how they explained what each core module was, how it worked and it's primary use-cases.
      - this made it much easier to understand and pick up because it was more "organized" than AWS was about 5 years ago 

# References & Overview for Azure Data Fundamentals DP-900

- [My notes I used to pass the exam](./DP-900%20Azure%20Data%20Fundamentals.md)
- Udemy Course: [DP-900: Microsoft Azure Data Fundamentals in a Weekend](https://www.udemy.com/course/dp-900-azure-data-fundamentals-certification/) 
  - chosen because of quizzes in addition to practice exam - and had ~ 8h of content which was long enough to cover details, but not spend time relearning the basics 
  
  ## My Study Path & Exam Review 

  - Go through the learning path(s) and take [notes](./DP-900%20Azure%20Data%20Fundamentals.md)
  - Covered the [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/dp-900-azure-data-fundamentals-certification/)
  - Take the [free practice exam](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exams/dp-900/practice/assessment?assessmentId=24&assessment-type=practice) twice & cover missed question topics 
  - Review notes prior to the exam 

  - **Review of the Exam** 
    - This exam was a breeze with the Udemy course, definitely needed this to answer some of the oddball questions that the learning paths did not cover!
    - definitely some stranger questions surrounding the detailed usage of PowerBI & a focus on ACID and the clustered/nonclustered indexes 
    - But I was able to pass this exam on the first try!

  - **Reflection**
    - I wouldn't make any other changes to how I approached this exam or how I would recommend it for others.

  ## My Study Path & Exam Review 

  - Watched the videos from the [exam readiness zone](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/exam-readiness-zone/preparing-for-dp-203-design-and-implement-data-storage-1-of-3) and discovered this is VERY different from the Fundamentals courses 
    - the 3 videos are all more than 20min long and incredibly in-depth on the detailed requirements for setting up data storage, data processing & securing/optimizing processing
  - Go through the learning paths & take notes
